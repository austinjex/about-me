<h1>About Me</h1>
<p style = "font-size:140%;">I am an entry-level data analyst. I was first introduced to data analytics in the summer of 2022. After studying the basics of data analytics, I learned about the Google Data Analytics Professional Career Cerfticates. I began the course in August of 2022 while working a full-time time job in customer service. In November of 2022, I decided to work on the certificates full-time. I completed the final Google Career Certificate in December of 2022.
          <br><br>The Google Career Certificates taught me how to ask smart questions to make data-driven business decisions, how to prepare data for analysis, how to analyze data to answer business questions using spreadsheets and SQL, how to share data analysis findings (including the creation of data visualizations), and how to apply insights to solve problems.
          <br><br>I look forward to entering the field of data analytics. Currently, I am actively applying for positions as a data analyst. I am also working on adding some data analytics case studies to my portfolio to showcase and improve my skills. I'd be happy to chat with other professionals who are in the data analytics space and tak interest in me and my work. Feel free to reach out and connect with me if you are interested in starting a conversation. Also feel free to just take a look around if you want. Cheers!
